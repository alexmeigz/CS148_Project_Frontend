# CS148 Project: Nutriflix (Frontend)

## Summary
### Mission
Increase visibility, awareness, and accessibility for healthier eating and dieting.

### Vision
Foster a centralized platform for people with similar nutritional goals to connect and empower each other. 

### Background
While healthy eating resources are available on the web, there lacks a centralized, trustworthy platform for newly interested individuals to use and acquire information readily. We propose a solution to provide a platform for users to share with and support their community in achieving their healthier diet goals, as well as keeping each other motivated through tough times. Without knowing where to start, some people may give up and never achieve their goals; with our platform, we hope to provide the necessary convenience to those who want to give it a shot and keep them motivated to make a change for the better.

### Objective
Our web application will be a one-stop shop for nutritional food dieting regarding home cooking and eating out, as well as an informative and motivational hub to learn more and stay healthy!
